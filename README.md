Project completed by Chris Davis and Caitlin Evanishyn.
Submitted on January 11, 2022.

<!-- Task
With your partner(s), create a new Python project in Visual Studio Code and collaborate using Git/GitHub as you pair program your way through the features of the project.
Setup Steps
⦁	One of your team will create the GitHub repository for your project.
⦁	Add the other partner(s) as a collaborator after you have created the project on your computer and linked it to your GitHub repository
⦁	In the project, add the debugger for Python in Visual Studio Code
⦁	Create a main.py file to serve as the entry point for your application when you run it
⦁	Start creating classes. Start thinking through what every class “has” and “does” based on the user stories and instructor discussion.
⦁	Before you begin coding, write an algorithm that represents the steps necessary to play a game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock in a best-of-three format. By writing out the steps, it will make you think about every piece needed to bring the game to life. Please submit to your instructor Slack channel once completed for approval to start coding. Below is an example of how to get started:
⦁	Step 1: Display the rules of the game
⦁	Step 2: Ask how many human players will be playing
⦁	… etc
End Result
This is an example of what your user could see in the console when playing. Note the clear prompts for input and messages that show the result of each round -->
